  - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.  
  - Checked for missing values and handled duplicates.  
  - Categorized features into numerical and categorical variables.  
  - Visualized data distributions for better understanding.  

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Imputed missing values using statistical methods.  
  - Encoded categorical variables.  
  - Standardized numerical features for better model performance.  

- **Model Development**  
  - Implemented regression models to predict car prices.  
  - Evaluated models using appropriate performance metrics.  

- **Results & Insights**  
  - Identified key factors influencing used car prices.  
  - Analyzed model accuracy and areas for improvement.
